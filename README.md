This solutions consists in services and an REST API used to get and manipulate data from SÃ£o Paulo public agents and see if they matches any client in a bank database. It also analyze those data using descriptive statistics to find useful information about public agents, potential leads and bank clients.

You will have to create/configure a ".env" file.
 
You can run services locally using docker-compose (services/docker-compose.yml).

The main API can be started with "main.go".
